This is a Codespace (provided by Github). It's a development environment that you can use for the rest of the course for non-assignment related work. We've already configured this to use Python 3.11 so that you don't have to worry about installing it. 

You can add more plugins and change the interface theme by visiting the Extensions marketplace. However, please do not change the Python version you are using. 

# Get started 
1. Click on the ```Code``` button.
2. Click on the ```Create codespace on main``` button.

After starting your codespace, you should see something like this:
