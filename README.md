This is a Codespace (provided by Github). It's a development environment that you can use for the rest of the course for non-assignment related work. We've already configured the Python versions so that you don't have to worry about installing it. 

# Configuration details
This uses Python 3.11 and the One Monokai theme. You can add more features and change themes by visiting the Extensions page. However, please do not change the Python version you are using. 

# Get started 
1. Click on the ```Code``` button.
2. Click on the ```Create codespace on main``` button.

After starting your codespace, you should see something like this:

You can enter ```python --version``` in the terminal to check that Python is installed with the correct version (3.11.X)
